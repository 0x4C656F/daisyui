        ‚ÑπÔ∏è Please provide a link to a small, minimal example source code where issue can be reproduced. Without a link it will be hard to guess what is the cause of the problem and it will take more time to fix.

        ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can use a [Tailwind Play](https://daisyui.com/tailwindplay/) page or a [Stackblitz page](https://stackblitz.com/@saadeghi/collections/daisyui) or a public GitHub repo.

        ‚ÑπÔ∏è If the issue doesn't happen on [Tailwind Play](https://daisyui.com/tailwindplay/) it means it's not an issue from daisyUI.  
        It can be a config problem in your project ([ask here](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/discussions?discussions_q=)) or it can be an issue from your framework or CSS build tools.
